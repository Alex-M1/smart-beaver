  portfolio_slide_text_1: 'In this project the client requested a layout change.\n1. When we met we had the opportunity to take measurements and then we created several design options. One of the designs was the winner. The client was confident that this configuration would give her the ability to keep all things organized and also enable her to prepare meals for celebration of important events, doing so quickly and in large volumes. We agreed upon the specifications for the manufacturing of the cabinets, the colors and built-in elements.Then, we signed the contract. Right away, the contractors got to work.\nThey got rid of the wall and moved all utilities like plumbing, electric and HVAC just as it was indicated on the 2D plan. They prepared the walls and flooring for cabinet installation.\nAfter all cabinets are set in place using laser leveling, our partners come in to install granite, quartz or any other countertop material of the client\'s choosing. After that we get to the point where we install the backsplash, connect the sink and faucet, garbage disposal and dishwasher. And that is all, the project is done. Enjoy!',
  portfolio_slide_text_2: 'This was a very interesting project. We needed to manufacture new cabinets that would match the style of the beautiful over 100-year-old brick and slate roof house. The planning of this project took a little longer than usual.We had to leave everything in the same exact layout except for the addition of one window.But we had to do so without letting a single square inch go to waste. A butcher pantry was built in in a traditional variant with cherry countertop.A charging station was added in one of the drawers to allow convenient charging while also hiding the wires from the eyes, avoiding a disorganized look.',
  portfolio_slide_text_3: 'As you know, we can make any type of cabinet no matter the color, size or finish. Our customer showed us a vanity from a store that they really liked. But the vanity from the store didn\'t fit the layout of the master bathroom.So of course we decided to help.We took all the measurements and in 8 weeks we created the vanity with the same design and storage features that the client desired, but of course it fit the client\'s space perfectly.The customer was very happy with the end result, and so were we.It feels amazing to be able to provide the cabinetry our clients want with superior quality of craftsmanship!',

Strongly recommend for any remodeling!!!',

  review_text_2: 'We hired Alex to put in an entirely new kitchen. I thought it would be cost-prohibitive and have too long of a timeline to be feasible — to my surprise, it was neither. I felt Smart Beaver prices were incredibly fair (in line with the other proposal we got), and the timeline was shockingly fast. Their team showed up exactly when they said they would, worked quietly and cleanly, and completed the job faster and better than I could have ever expected. Even with a few little changes along the way (choices we were making), they were able to adjust, accommodate, and stay on schedule.',

  faq_description: 'Below you will find the FAQ that will help you familiarize yourself with our products and services. Please contact us if you have additional questions.',
  faq_question_1: 'Do you have a showroom?',
  faq_answer_1: 'We do not have a showroom as it would be an additional overhead cost that would be passed on to the client.',
  faq_question_2: 'Can I see samples of your work?',
  faq_answer_2: 'Of course you can. First we would provide you with a quote. If the quote is within your budget and you are thinking about moving forward, you can request an appointment at our office where we can show you different samples.',
  faq_question_3: 'Why are there no prices on the website?',
  faq_answer_3: 'We realized that there are a lot of variables when it comes to the cost of manufacturing cabinetry. We base our quotes primarily on the cost of labor and materials. If you are buying in bulk, the price per item will be less than if you were ordering only one cabinet. Every project is unique and we recommend that you take advantage of our online form so we can provide you with an accurate estimate. You can also contact us directly if you want to give us details on the project and get an estimate.',
  faq_question_4: 'Can you help with measurements and kitchen design?',
  faq_answer_4: 'Yes. We offer a free consultation if you live within 1 hour from Cleveland, OH. You can contact us to schedule an appointment and we will visit to measure your kitchen and discuss your plans for the project in more detail. Then, we will use your measurements to create a 3D design and blueprint of your kitchen.',
  faq_question_5: 'Are all cabinets made of 100% wood?',
  faq_answer_5: 'Yes, all our cabinets are made of solid wood. We never plan on using any kind of particle board. Our goal is to provide you with cabinetry that you will be able to enjoy for many years and we realize it would not be possible without high quality solid wood and hardware. We also offer a more budget friendly option for cabinets with solid wood door frames and MDF-fiberboard inset panels.',
  faq_question_6: 'Do you offer formaldehyde-free cabinets?',
  faq_answer_6: 'Yes, with the growing concern for our environment, we offer cabinet shells made out of Purebond Plywood made by Columbia Forest Products. This is a soy-based formaldehyde-free hard plywood and it is U.S. Green Building Council compliant. As this product is becoming more available at a more competitive price, we strive to eventually offer this option on all of our cabinets.',
